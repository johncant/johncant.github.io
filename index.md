# Introduction

Hello, my name is John, and I'm a data scientist and software engineer based in London, UK. In the past, I cofounded BeHiring, Airpublic and Sententia Ex Data, and worked at Reevoo, Boppl, Juper, AMEE, Zoaring Adaptive X, VEEPIO, Photobox, and Shell.

## Languages

Professionally, I almost entirely use Python and SQL, but consider myself language-agnostic. In the past, I have used C, C++, Haskell, Java, Scala, Clojure, Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, FORTRAN77, Basic, and R.

# Data Science and ML

This is what I do day-to-day.

# Self-hosting

I self-host quite a lot of things from inside my house.

# Hacker mentality

To me, this involves curiosity, creativity, pushing technological limits, problem solving, enjoying building stuff, outside the box, pragmatism, and meritocracy.
