##Introduction

Hello, my name is John, and I'm a data scientist and software engineer based in London, UK. In the past, I cofounded BeHiring, and worked at Reevoo, Boppl, Juper, AMEE, and Zoaring Adaptive X. At the moment, I am an independent consulting data scientist [available for hire](mailto:hello@sententiaexdata.com). I run [Data Science Clinic London](http://www.meetup.com/data-science-clinic-london/events/224831227/), London's first and only data science help session.

I'm going to use this blog to showcase my side projects, establish some
web presence, act as a point of contact, and shamelessly plug my
[consultancy services](http://www.sententiaexdata.com).

##Languages

Professionally, I tend to use Python to develop with data efficiently, but
I consider myself a polyglot, proficient in C/C++, Haskell, Java, Clojure,
Ruby, Javascript, FORTRAN77, and R. Sets of Languages I have combined using wrappers
or FFIs include (Haskell, Javascript), (Clojure, Java), (Clojure, Javascript), (C++, Javascript)
(C++, Java), and (Ruby, C).

#Modelling, prediction, and learning

My degree was in Engineering Science, which was very useful for the continuous
maths it taught me. I use books, papers, blogs, Coursera, and experimentation
to learn about new algorithms, techniques, and theorems. It's usually necessary
to combine, modify, and repurpose existing algorithms for specific use cases.
Therefore, I make no attempt to quantify my algorithmic toolchain.

#Data

Fluency in SQL. I have also used Hadoop, Spark, Theano, Cascalog, and ZeroMQ

#Visualization

Custom. MatPlotLib, Bokeh, WebGL.

#Side projects
This is partly what I live for. I'll post about my side projects soon, but here's a brief list:

  - [Does my flight go through a war
  zone](http://www.doesmyflightgothroughawarzone.com)
  - Accelerate + Symbolic Differentiation = Theano for Haskell
  - Project ninja - Open air sound cancellation.
  - Constrained 3d reconstruction - Aid the 3d reconstruction process
  using hard constraints
  - More intelligent reverse code engineering. Society needs this to
  detect and neutralize NSA backdoors
  - TotalExposure - Estimate pollution breathed in by an individual. TODO - attribution to other team members
  - AirPublic - Measure pollution using a swarm of mobile sensors. TODO - attribution to other team members
  - Actually build something (anything) good by compiling Haskell into
  JavaScript
