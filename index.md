##Introduction

Hello, my name is John, and I'm a data scientist and software engineer based in London, UK. In the past, I cofounded BeHiring, Airpublic and Sententia Ex Data, and worked at Reevoo, Boppl, Juper, AMEE, Zoaring Adaptive X, VEEPIO, Photobox, and Shell.

##Languages

Professionally, I tend to use Python to develop with data efficiently, but I consider myself a polyglot, but predominantly I now use Python. I'm reasonably proficient in C/C++, Haskell, Java, Clojure, Ruby, Javascript, FORTRAN77, and R.

#Data Science and ML

This is what I typically do day-to-day. When asked about ML algorithms, I tend to say that understanding the problem and how to apply ML to each case, and choosing correct metrics and crossvalidation regime is usually far more important than the model itself.

#Data

Fluency in SQL and pandas. I have also used Hadoop and Spark.

#Visualization

Mainly MatPlotLib and Bokeh, but I've also got enough frontend development experience to build custom visualizations, including in WebGL.

#Self hosting
